    - Added Scrollbar to Textbox by changing into a ScrolledText widget. From tkinter.scrolledText 
	imported ScrolledText
    - Changed to inputBox into a listbox, trying to add scroller. Added a scrollbar to the side of
	the window, trying to add it to side of listbox. Was able to remove the import just done.
    - Ability to select multiple items from scrollBox, need to add ability to print and convert
	all selections.
    - Added ability to convert files added to listBox. Getting error because last element in the split
	list (in PDFfuncs) is blank string

    - Removed ".upper" from filename when saving image
    - Added "Remove" button to remove selected files.
	***Error while adding remove button*** -> for loop used to delete inputBox index, however when one was
			being deleted, the value of curselection was pointing to a different object in the list
    - Fixed Error, remove button works as intended.
    - added "sorted(events)" to 'drop_inside_listbox' function.
